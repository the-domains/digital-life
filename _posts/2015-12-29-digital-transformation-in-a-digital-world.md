# Digital Transformation In A Digital World

I work for Adobe, where I run two of the largest UK banks.   
My role is to help these orginisations deliver against their digital priorities by implementing Adobe's Makreting Cloud software. 

The priorities that I have seen in the last year from these two banking giants are as follows:

Customer Experience Centricity:

The development of marketing, communication and advertising strategies that combines the customer journey with the marketing funnel to optimise the journey to remove friction, fallout & failure. 

In addition to this journey management, banks are looking to stitch together a customer across all touch points, from branch through to app to allow one-to-one matching and specific marketing optimisation. 

All of these things leads to the a relevant and optimised customer experience. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9db42df7-1ff9-49de-af85-bfc1650c314e.jpg)
