description: "It might surprise you to know that after the widespread derision aimed at the first version of Google Glass, the tech giant is readying a second iteration, and now we know what it will look like. Although it's not that different from the first, it's going to be aimed at enterprises, as several reports earlier in the year from 9to5Google suggested."
